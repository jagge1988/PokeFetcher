# PokeFetcher

The PokeFetcher will fetch Pokemon in your area to sea which Pokemon are available around you. I use the pokevision to find the pokemon, so there could be a delay of up to 2 minutes. 

Please use maven install to compile. You can run the jar with two arguments to set the position (lat, lon). No parameter yet for save-file.
